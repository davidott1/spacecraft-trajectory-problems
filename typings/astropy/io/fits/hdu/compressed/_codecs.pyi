class Gzip2(Codec):

    The FITS GZIP2 compression and decompression algorithm.

    The gzip2 algorithm is a variation on 'GZIP 1'. In this case the buffer in
    the array of data values are shuffled so that they are arranged in order of
    decreasing significance before being compressed.

    For example, a five-element contiguous array of two-byte (16-bit) integer
    values, with an original big-endian byte order of:

    .. math::
        A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 D1 D2 E1 E2

    will have the following byte order after shuffling:

    .. math::
        A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 A2 B2 C2 D2 E2,

    where A1, B1, C1, D1, and E1 are the most-significant buffer from
    each of the integer values.

    Byte shuffling shall only be performed for integer or floating-point
    numeric data types; logical, bit, and character types must not be shuffled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    itemsize

class Rice1(Codec):

    The FITS RICE1 compression and decompression algorithm.

    The Rice algorithm [1]_ is simple and very fast It requires only enough
    memory to hold a single block of 16 or 32 pixels at a time. It codes the
    pixels in small blocks and so is able to adapt very quickly to changes in
    the input image statistics (e.g., Rice has no problem handling cosmic rays,
    bright stars, saturated pixels, etc.).

    Parameters
    ----------
    blocksize
        The blocksize to use, each tile is coded into blocks a number of pixels
        wide. The default value in FITS headers is 32 pixels per block.

    bytepix
        The number of 8-bit buffer in each original integer pixel value.

class HCompress1(Codec):
    """
    The FITS HCompress compression and decompression algorithm.

    Hcompress is an the image compression package written by Richard L. White
    for use at the Space Telescope Science Institute. Hcompress was used to
    compress the STScI Digitized Sky Survey and has also been used to compress
    the preview images in the Hubble Data Archive.

    The technique gives very good compression for astronomical images and is
    relatively fast. The calculations are carried out using integer arithmetic
    and are entirely reversible. Consequently, the program can be used for
    either lossy or lossless compression, with no special approach needed for
    the lossless case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scale
        The integer scale parameter determines the amount of compression. Scale
        = 0 or 1 leads to lossless compression, i.e. the decompressed image has
        exactly the same pixel values as the original image. If the scale
        factor is greater than 1 then the compression is lossy: the
        decompressed image will not be exactly the same as the original

    smooth
        At high compressions factors the decompressed image begins to appear
        blocky because of the way information is discarded. This blockiness
        ness is greatly reduced, producing more pleasing images, if the image
        is smoothed slightly during decompression.
