    Header object for compressed image HDUs designed to keep the compression
    header and the underlying image header properly synchronized.

    This essentially wraps the image header, so that all values are read from
    and written to the image header.  However, updates to the image header will
    also update the table header where appropriate.

    Note that if no image header is passed in, the code will instantiate a
    regular `~astropy.io.fits.Header`.
