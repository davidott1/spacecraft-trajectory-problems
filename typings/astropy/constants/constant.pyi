    In particular this wraps the operator overloads such as `__add__` to
    prevent their use with constants such as ``e`` from being used in
    expressions without specifying a system.  The wrapper checks to see if the
    constant is listed (by name) in ``Constant._has_incompatible_units``, a set
    of those constants that are defined in different systems of units are
    physically incompatible.  It also performs this check on each `Constant` if
    it hasn't already been performed (the check is deferred until the
    `Constant` is actually used in an expression to speed up import times,
    among other reasons).

    Parameters
    ----------
    abbrev : str
        A typical ASCII text abbreviation of the constant, generally
        the same as the Python variable used for this constant.
    name : str
        Full constant name.
    value : numbers.Real
        Constant value. Note that this should be a bare number, not a
        |Quantity|.
    unit : str
        String representation of the constant units.
    uncertainty : numbers.Real
        Absolute uncertainty in constant value. Note that this should be
        a bare number, not a |Quantity|.
    reference : str, optional
        Reference where the value is taken from.
    system : str
        System of units in which the constant is defined. This can be
        `None` when the constant's units can be directly converted
        between systems.
