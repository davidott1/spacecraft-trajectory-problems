This package defines deprecated units.

These units are not available in the top-level `astropy.units`
namespace. To use these units, you must import the `astropy.units.deprecated`
module::

    >>> from astropy.units import deprecated
    >>> q = 10. * deprecated.emu  # doctest: +SKIP

To include them in `~astropy.units.UnitBase.compose` and the results of
`~astropy.units.UnitBase.find_equivalent_units`, do::

    >>> from astropy.units import deprecated
    >>> deprecated.enable()  # doctest: +SKIP

    Enable deprecated units so they appear in results of
    `~astropy.units.UnitBase.find_equivalent_units` and
    `~astropy.units.UnitBase.compose`.

    This may be used with the ``with`` statement to enable deprecated
    units only temporarily.
