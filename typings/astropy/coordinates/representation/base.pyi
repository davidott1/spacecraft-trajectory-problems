    define a ``to_cartesian`` method and a ``from_cartesian`` class method. By
    default, transformations are done via the cartesian system, but classes
    that want to define a smarter transformation path can overload the
    ``represent_as`` method. If one wants to use an associated differential
    class, one should also define ``unit_vectors`` and ``scale_factors``
    methods (see those methods for details).

        base : instance of ``cls.base_representation``
            Base relative to which the differentials are defined.  If the other
            class is a differential representation, the base will be converted
            to its ``base_representation``.
        transformed_base : instance of ``cls.base_representation``
            Base relative to which the transformed differentials are defined.
            If the other class is a differential representation, the base will
            be converted to its ``base_representation``.

        The norm is the standard Frobenius norm, i.e., the square root of the
        sum of the squares of all components with non-angular units.

        Parameters
        ----------
        base : instance of ``self.base_representation``
            Base relative to which the differentials are defined. This is
            required to calculate the physical size of the differential for
            all but Cartesian differentials or radial differentials.

        Returns
        -------
        norm : `astropy.units.Quantity`
            Vector norm, with the same shape as the representation.
