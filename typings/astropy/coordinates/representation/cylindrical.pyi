class CylindricalRepresentation(BaseRepresentation):
    """
    Representation of points in 3D cylindrical coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The distance from the z axis to the point(s).

    phi : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or str
        The azimuth of the point(s), in angular units, which will be wrapped
        to an angle between 0 and 360 degrees. This can also be instances of
        `~astropy.coordinates.Angle`,

    z : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The z coordinate(s) of the point(s)

    differentials : dict, `~astropy.coordinates.CylindricalDifferential`, optional
        Any differential classes that should be associated with this
        representation. The input must either be a single
        `~astropy.coordinates.CylindricalDifferential` instance, or a dictionary of of differential
        instances with keys set to a string representation of the SI unit with
        which the differential (derivative) is taken. For example, for a
        velocity differential on a positional representation, the key would be
        ``'s'`` for seconds, indicating that the derivative is a time
        derivative.

    copy : bool, optional
        If `True` (default), arrays will be copied. If `False`, arrays will
        be references, though possibly broadcast to ensure matching shapes.
